**My main concern is the effect of the disappearance of the Other on democracy.**

I believe that the existence of the Other is crucial. The Other represents different interests and perspectives and, through their participation and expression, can provide diversity and representativeness. The presence of the Other promotes comprehensiveness in public debate, exchange of views, and decision-making.

**The first concern is how digital technology makes the Other disappear and undermines democracy.**

The Internet has changed not only our perceptions and behaviors as individuals but also our culture and the way we communicate as a society. The Internet has fostered the phenomenon of a "global village", where people are connected through networks, forming different communities, interest groups, and identities. However, while this phenomenon is conducive to pluralism and inclusiveness, it also has the potential to lead to social fragmentation, polarisation, and prejudice.

**The second concern is the disappearance of the Other in our lives.**

The disappearance of the "neighborhood". In the neighborhood, individuals from different backgrounds are constantly encountering each other. The neighborhood brings different positions into the same field of vision, thus constituting a field of view. In this field of vision, people can develop a more nuanced understanding of reality, which leads to the development of new social relations and behaviors. A sense of neighborhood prevents the local community from becoming a unit of administrative control and a place for capital to capture value.

One of the reasons for this is the loss of 'neighborhood' in the public consciousness.
Urban designers have been promoting the idea of a "15-minute city (living sphere)" where residents can meet all their daily needs within a 15-minute walk or ride. Real estate developers and government officials have promised to make residential neighborhoods safe, clean, and orderly. They have also become strategic locations for sales promotion and data extraction. However, these locally orientated developments often dilute social relationships and isolate individuals from each other. Neighborhoods as horizons help to reconfigure relationships in everyday life, creating social self-preservation.      
Neighborhoods and workspaces, the places of daily interaction, disappear. It is difficult to describe who we meet daily, or what changes are taking place around us. My point of view is the global point of view, and to disagree with me is to violate axioms.

Use the neighborhood as a basis for seeing the world. If a citizen learns about the world through the neighborhood, she will know who the nannies, cleaners, security guards, and maintenance workers are in the neighborhood, and will talk to the hairdressers and vendors who live close to the neighborhood, but who do not have access to it. she will find out how the neighborhood was built: what was the original use of the land, where did the original inhabitants go, and under what conditions did they leave. In this way, she reflects on what separated people and what forces and conditions now bring them together. Understanding the different perspectives of different groups of people will enable her to be aware of the different demands when thinking about public affairs, whether it is transport, waste separation, welfare reform, etc. The neighborhood will give people the ability to observe in a way that they would not otherwise be able to. 

"This is an outward manifestation of the homogenization and alienation of the 'neighborhood'. This shift is related to the development of society and affects our experience of time, space, and emotions. 



**Now Research Direction.**

Recently, I felt a profound sense of emptiness that prevented me from continuing in my original direction of the graduation project, so I began to explore inwardly the source of my feelings of emptiness. I would like to share my feelings and thoughts on this process.

There were many reasons why I developed a sense of emptiness. Firstly, I had to go back to my home country to take care of my grandmother due to her illness. During the time I was back home, I felt like waking up from a dream and realized that I had only idealized many things. My study life in the UK seemed to become distant and blurred. Secondly, my relationship with my parents was also in trouble. They forcefully asked me to fall in love and take the civil service exam as soon as possible, which made me feel resentful and sad. There was a big difference between my values and theirs, and there were more and more conflicts between us. Once again, I felt confused and scared about my future. I learned that the employment environment in China is very bad, many people are unemployed and many students can't find a job. Although I was interested in what I was learning, I didn't know if it could bring me value and meaning. I even began to think about whether to try the civil service job that I had always hated. Finally, I had a setback in my relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend, but I couldn't get back together with him because my pride and reality got in the way. I felt a blurring and uncertainty of morals and values in the face of different cultures, different values, and a plethora of digital media. I feel like I'm oscillating between two extremes (traditional and new values) and I can't find where I belong or what I aspire to be.



**Explore the reasons for feeling nothingness.**

Attempts are made to understand the causes of nothingness by reading books, reading literature, watching videos, and talking to friends and family.
